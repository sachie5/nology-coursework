//** CSS Grid Color Picker

Create a small web application that features a 10x10 grid of tiles. Users will be able to select a color using the HTML color picker element, and when they click on a tile within the grid, the background color of the tile should change to the selected color.

- Create an HTML file with a container element that will hold the grid and the color picker. 
- Include an HTML color picker input element within the container.
- Reasearch CSS Grid and use it to create a 10x10 grid of square div tiles within the grid container. 
- Give the tiles a border to ensure the grid is clear.
- Write JavaScript code to handle the following functionality:
  - When a user selects a color using the color picker, the selected color should be stored in a variable.
  - When a user clicks on a tile within the grid, the background color of the clicked tile should change to the currently selected color.
  - Provide visual feedback to indicate which color is currently selected.

The Project should have its own Github Repository and should uses SCSS for styling. */
